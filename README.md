# 100-Days-MLCode-Challenge

This is my first trial at the Siraj Raval Email Spam classifier challenge. 
The idea was to create a Machine Learning Model using the Naive Bayes Algorithm , that is able to classifier correctly "Spam" and "Ham" emails.
The accuracy obtained was about 99%. 
The dataset used was considerably small, it's also my first attempt at sentiment analysis so i tried to use a simple model.
More updates in the future.
